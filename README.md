## AWS Components and Architecture üõ†Ô∏è

### AWS Services Used
1. **SageMaker**: Hosted the custom generative AI models, including:
   - Stable Diffusion with VAE for enhanced image generation.
   - LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models for stylized image outputs.
   - Deployed models for both text-to-image and image-to-image tasks.
2. **Elastic Beanstalk**: Managed application deployment, ensuring high availability and scalability of the web application.
3. **Amazon Bedrock**: Llama 3 and Stable Diffusion XL model invocation.
4. **DynamoDB**: Used for storing user-generated content, metadata, and user data.
5. **CloudWatch**: Monitored application performance, logging errors, and tracking system metrics.
6. **S3**: Stored static assets and user-uploaded files for img2img processing.
7. **IAM**: Defined granular access control for secure communication between AWS services and the application.
8. **CodePipeline**: CI/CD development.

## How It Works üß†

### 1. Text-to-Image (txt2img)
Users provide a text prompt to describe the desired image. The custom Stable Diffusion model, enhanced with VAE, generates a high-quality image based on the description.

### 2. Image-to-Image (img2img)
Users upload an image and apply modifications using LoRA models for specific styles. The system processes the input image and outputs an enhanced version.

### 3. Blog Content Generation
Users specify the blog topic, desired word count, and style. The platform leverages a language model to generate content, summarize, or rephrase the blog text.
